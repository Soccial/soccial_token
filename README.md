# Soccial Token (SCTK) - Smart Contract

## üß± Overview

The **Soccial Token (SCTK)** is a utility token built on the **Solana blockchain**, serving as the economic foundation of the [Soccial](https://www.soccial.com/thetoken) social network.

It enables users to:

- Purchase services within the Soccial platform.
- Buy/sell Collaboration Cards (gamification).
- Participate in governance through on-chain voting.
- Earn rewards by staking or contributing to the ecosystem.
- Engage in a hybrid decentralized economy.
- Over time, the goal is to make the token a practical payment method not only within Soccial, but also for third-party products and services that align with the platform's ecosystem.

Soccial Token (SCTK) has a fixed supply of 500 million tokens, which means its value has the potential to grow hand in hand with the platform‚Äôs expansion ‚Äî especially as the volume of transactions and business activity within Soccial increases.

### üí° A Project Born from Years of Work and a lot Passion

The **Soccial platform** - a new kind of social network - was built over the course of many years, completely from scratch, with no investors, no funding, and no team. Just one developer and one other invaluable founder (Isabel Pinto), both driven by an idea and a deep desire to create something different.

The Soccial Token (SCTK) was developed later,  to serve as the economic engine of that same network - and to open up a fair, community-driven economy around it.

This project isn‚Äôt powered by hype - it‚Äôs powered by work, persistence, resilience and the belief that something meaningful for the community can be built without permission, without millions - it's not just a product, but a foundation for true community-owned value to emerge.

We don‚Äôt have marketing funds, so reaching people is hard. But if you‚Äôve found us now, you‚Äôre not just early - you‚Äôre part of how this story begins.

This isn‚Äôt about hype. We‚Äôre not buying bots or chasing empty numbers. We‚Äôre choosing the long road - one built on real belief, real people, and real progress.

**Thank you for being part of it.**

### ü§ù Open Source

This smart contract powers the core SCTK logic and is fully open-source.

It was developed by **Paulo Rodrigues**, co-founder of Soccial, with the goal of promoting transparency, trust, and community collaboration.

I believe open source is about sharing, collaborating, and building something greater together. Feel free to fork it, adapt it, and integrate it into your own project - just make it count ‚Äî build something that matters.

> üí° **For developers**
> 
> The code is made publicly available for full transparency on Soccial Token and to encourage developers to learn from it, reuse it, help improve it and share their ideas.
>
> Even if you don‚Äôt plan to use the full contract or its modules, I strongly recommend checking out the test helpers - they can save you months of work when building and validating your own Solana programs.
> 
>This contract wasn't designed to be used directly as-is, but with a few copy-pastes and minor adjustments, it can easily turn 3‚Äì4 months of development into just 2‚Äì3 days of integration.

 After years developing [Soccial](https://www.soccial.com) ‚Äì the social network behind the Soccial Token
, I was never able to open-source any of the previous systems, even though that was always something I dreamed of doing.

So when I began building the Soccial Token contract, I decided from day one that it had to be fully open source. This project is my personal contribution to the Web3 community and the Solana ecosystem - a way of giving back and empowering others to build faster, smarter, and more transparently.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This contract is provided **"as is"**, without any warranty of functionality, security, or suitability for any purpose. Use at your own risk.



## üß© Main Features
- **Initialize:** Initializes the token and allocates supply into contract-controlled vaults.
- **Tokenomics:** Controlled supply and automated distribution only through vaults.
- **Governance:** On-chain proposal and voting system for protocol-level decisions.
- **Airdrop Management:** Vault-controlled airdrops with cooldown and limited logic and eligibility checks.
- **Staking:** Stake SCTK to earn rewards through customizable plans.
- **Vesting:** Time-based vesting for team, advisors, and early contributors.
- **Vault System:** Segregated, contract-controlled vaults for airdrop, insurance, liquidity, off-chain reserve, reserved supply, revenue, rewards, staking, treasury, and vesting. Each vault operates with its own set of permissions and access rules. Some vaults require governance approval before they can be used.
- **Offchain market system** Token marketplace designed for use within the Soccial platform. Supports token purchases, deposits from off-chain Soccial vaults (with fees), and direct acquisitions using staked tokens.
- **Rewards Vault**  A special vault that can only be filled through contract-controlled fee revenue. It‚Äôs used to reward users in the Soccial Cards game, where players can unpack rare cards with a chance to win between 1% and 100% of the vault total balance. Users must choose how long they‚Äôre willing to wait before someone else has a chance to claim it - adding strategy, risk, and excitement to the reward system.
- **Fees System** A fully configurable fee system managed by the smart contract and governance controlled.
- **Access Control:** Role-based permissions (owner, admin, staff, user, early adopter) with secure enforcement.
- **Emergency Stop:** System pause and rollback capabilities for critical incident handling.
- **Event Logging:** Uses `emit!` and `msg!` to log all major on-chain actions, ensuring full traceability, transparency, and ease of debugging and auditing.
- **Centralized Permission Logic:** All permission checks are defined in `lib.rs` for clarity and ease of review. Only the `vaults` module


## üß† Logic and Security Guide
### Architecture of the Contract
The contract is fully modular, with each feature implemented in an isolated module. This ensures clean separation of concerns, extensibility, and testability.
- **lib.rs:** Main entry point, linking all modules.
- **airdrop.rs:** Manages controlled airdrops with cooldown periods.  
- **auth.rs:** Handles role-based access control (owner, admin, staff, user).  
- **economics.rs:** Controls token distribution logic and vault-based economics.  
- **governance.rs:** Handles voting and proposal creation.  
- **market.rs:** Manages the internal off-chain token market within the Soccial platform.  
- **staking.rs:** Allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards.  
- **token.rs:** Core logic related to supply and token state.  
- **utils.rs:** Provides shared helper functions, math utilities, and macros.  
- **vaults.rs:** Handles all contract-controlled vaults, each with specific permissions and usage (e.g. rewards, treasury, liquidity).  
- **vesting.rs:** Manages token vesting for team, investors, and marketing partnerships.

### Security Measures
1. **Access Control:** Only the contract owner or authorized addresses can execute critical functions.
2. **Rate Limiting:** Airdrop functions include maximum usage limits and cooldown periods to prevent abuse and ensure fair distribution.
3. **Governance Participation:** Community voting ensures transparency in major decisions.
4. **Data Integrity:** All state changes are recorded on-chain and are verifiable.
5. **Emergency Stop:** Allows halting of all critical operations to prevent further damage during an attack.
6. **Audit Trails:** The contract automatically logs andall actions for transparency.
7. **API-Gated Execution:** Most instructions must be triggered via Soccial's off-chain API, with only user-owned token recovery functions exposed publicly. This reduces the attack surface and helps mitigate DDoS and similar abuse attempts by routing logic through an adaptive off-chain gateway.


### Community Governance
The contract uses a decentralized governance model where token holders can vote on important changes. Founders are excluded from voting on financial decisions to maintain fairness.
- **Quorum:** A minimum percentage of the circulating supply must participate for a vote to be valid. Initially set to 0% to allow early adoption, with plans to increase it as the community grows.
- **Voting Period:** Votes are open for a fixed period of 7 days (configurable).

### Audit and Verification
- **Automated Reporting:** The contract generates reports after critical actions.
- **On-Chain Data:** Key metrics will be available on Soccial platform for public verification.
- **Code Audits:** Open source to allow third-party reviews.

## Next version
In the next version:
- Configurable Vesting on airdrops
- Command to make the mint immutable - and make it! It is controlled by a vault, but it is possible to mint with a non transparent contract upgrade.
- Command to make metadata immutable
- Remove initialize modules - The token is one, we don't need it anymore
